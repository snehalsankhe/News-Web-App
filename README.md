# News-Web-App
We’ll be implementing a news application with updated and lateset news. We’ll have how to fetch data from a third party API

# Introduction
The news application that we’ll be creating with React JS and integrated with a backend, will let a user search for news articles. We’ll begin by creating a new file api.js inside /src. Inside the file, we’ll be creating functions to make requests to the API. We’ll be using the Fetch API to fetch information from the API. We will be displaying it on UI in the form of listing view. We will add a search bar so a user can search for topics that they’re interested of.
